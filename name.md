title: "Where do the names \"FreeNT\" and \"OpenWindows\" come from?"
excerpt: "Please spread the word. FreeNT is open-source."

{: .note }
This is an essay. It's nothing to do with development. There should be general consensus whether this should be moved to the FreeNT README. This document also explains OpenWindows's name, so the specific parts would be put into the FreeNT and OpenWindows READMEs respectively.

FreeNT stands for **Free** Software **N**ew **T**echnology. The name originated from a pun, "Is Windows free?", which many people
have asked since Microsoft started offering free install disks for Windows, which aren't open-source, despite the
word "free" (the FreeNT Project uses the word free in most of the case to refer to freedom, not price).

## And now OpenWindows

The OpenWindows name is not an abberivation, but rather a clone of the name "Windows", used by Microsoft to refer
to their operating systems. The "Open" prefix was added to clarify that OpenWindows is open-source.

{: .note }
OpenWindows is sometimes called "FreeNT OpenWindows" or "OpenWindows system" to distinguish it from an obsolete window manager by Sun Microsystems, which is currently documented on Wikipedia. OpenWindows is not abandonware, and it most likely won't for a long time.

When using the name OpenWindows, please do not use it to refer to Microsoft Windows.
The name of the FreeNT Project's operating system, OpenWindows, is misleading for a proprietary operating system,
hence the first component of the name, "Open".

## Several other projects

### owboot
The name `owboot`, often named "OWBoot" (CamelCase), "bootloader" or "Fortoti Ekkinisis" under
non-technical perspectives, stands for **O**pen**W**indows **Boot**loader.
This is a play on other bootloader names, such as Apple's iBoot.

### FreeNT Docs
This is the original name for OpenWindows, with "Docs" added as an additional word, to indicate
that it is not the actual kernel, but rather the developer documentation, which also references
OpenWindows several times.

### OpenWindows License
The OpenWindows License is a legal document, whose name originates from the name OpenWindows.
Sometimes, it is referenced with a version number (latest: 1.0) after the name.

### freent-module-...
This is the name of several Git repositories, most of which are not owned by the FreeNT project.
Be careful when downloading repositories with these names, as they may be viruses that "inject" code
into the kernel.

Since OpenWindows can easily add itself to the list of the three major desktop platforms,
you should scan modules with antiviruses before installing them, unless the author is the FreeNT
Project and you understand it *is* the FreeNT Project, whereas the module is official and safe.
The FreeNT project has never, and will not, write any malware for any operating system, including
OpenWindows itself.

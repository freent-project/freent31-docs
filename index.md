This documentation is intended for developers. If you are not a developer, you are not at the right place. OpenWindows 11 help is available at https://freent-project.github.io/openwindows11-help.

FreeNT replaces Windows with an open-source operating system. From command-lines such
as `fntsh` to kernel modules such as `win32-vm`, FreeNT is powerful.

The FreeNT Documentation documents FreeNT kernel calls and FreeNT development.

title: "Why not use Microsoft Windows NT?"
excerpt: "It's not free."

{: .note }
This is an essay. It's nothing to do with development. There should be general consensus whether this should be moved to the OpenWindows README.

FreeNT's goal is to completely create Windows NT under GNU-FS and OSS guidelines.
Microsoft Windows NT is a proprietary product and cannot be used in OpenWindows.
